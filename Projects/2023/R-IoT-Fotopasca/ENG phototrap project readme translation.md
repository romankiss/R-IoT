# Phototrap

## Progress so far  
![ESP32 and PIR movement sensor](https://github.com/romankiss/R-IoT/assets/59760649/923af352-fe12-4d16-89da-fdbeb8ebde39)      
(the connections are just illustratious, real ones may vary)

## Future visions  
It would be nice to achieve high fault tolerancy in this system.     
To eliminate centralised data storage the IPFS might be used(P2P distributed protocol for content adressed data storage).  
Having alternative routes to connect to the internet might be challenging. LoRa or some long range WiFi mod. would come useful.
