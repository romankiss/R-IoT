<h2>16x8 LED Matrix SimpleHT16K33 Driver</h2>

Atomic Motion Base is a servo and DC motor driver designed specifically for the ATOM series controllers. It integrates an STM32 control chip internally and uses I2C communication for control. Atomic Motion Base provides 4 servo channels and 2 DC motor interfaces, offering convenience for scenarios that require control of multiple servos or motor drivers, such as multi-axis servo robotic arms or small car motor control.
